## Session Summary - August 19, 2025
Successfully established project documentation framework and fixed timezone issue:
- Created comprehensive development guide (CLAUDE.md)
- Documented complete architecture and planning (PLANNING.md) 
- Set up session tracking system (SESSION.md)
- Initialized task management structure (TASKS.md)
- Enhanced timezone handling in menu.go for guaranteed Central Time display
- Added robust fallback mechanisms for timezone loading
- Improved debugging with timezone logging

Technical changes: Enhanced menu timestamp to always show Central Time regardless of server deployment location, with fallback mechanisms and debug logging.

Next steps: Development priorities are documented in TASKS.md - focus on integration tests, code linting, and performance benchmarking.
