Severe thunderstorms are not expected through early Tuesday. ...Portions of the southern Appalachians to the Lower MS Valley... A few elevated thunderstorms will be possible, mainly in the late evening to overnight, across parts of the Cumberland Plateau and TN Valley. Modest low-level warm theta-e advection, peripherally attendant to a clipper shortwave trough progressing into the Great Lakes should support at least isolated showers. Predominately westerly low-level winds suggest MUCAPE will likely remain no greater than scant, yielding only very isolated thunderstorm potential. Farther west-southwest into the Lower MS Valley, while modest low-level warm advection is also anticipated tonight, relatively warm/dry mid-levels may mitigate appreciable thunderstorm development, resulting in unconditional probabilities around 10 percent or less. ..Grams/Gleason.. 02/20/2023 </pre> <a href="http://www.spc.noaa.gov/products/outlook/day1otlk.html">Read more</a> ]]>
