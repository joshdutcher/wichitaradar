			<p>One stormy day, right during the storms, my hosting provider shut down this site to perform a server upgrade.
			It was at that moment that MORE THAN ONE PERSON claimed that their very lives were in danger:</p>

			<div class="pure-u pure-u-1 pure-u-md-1-1 pure-u-lg-1-1">
				<img src="/img/fb-disclaimer.png" class="pure-img-responsive" >
			</div>
			<div class="pure-u pure-u-1 pure-u-md-1-1 pure-u-lg-1-1">
				<img src="/img/tw-disclaimer.png" class="pure-img-responsive" >
			</div>

			<p>So. Fer crissakes, don't rely on this site to guide you while making life or death (or even potentially medically catastrophic) decisions.</p>
